        answer: 0,
        explanation: "The correct sequence is: 1) Disconnect the infected machine from the network (to prevent spread), 2) Run an antivirus scan, 3) Notify the incident response team, 4) Restore files from backup. Isolation is always the first priority in ransomware cases."

            "Wipe all infected servers and reinstall OS"
        ],

        answer: 0,
        explanation: "For insider threats: 1) Immediately revoke access to prevent further damage, 2) Preserve evidence (logs, emails), 3) Escalate to HR/legal for proper investigation. Avoid confrontation before evidence collection."

        answer: 0,
        explanation: "For zero-days: 1) Isolate affected systems (containment), 2) Apply temporary mitigations like firewall rules, 3) Monitor for spread, 4) Apply vendor patch when available. Speed is critical."

            "Disconnect the system from the network immediately",
            "Run an antivirus scan and wait for results",
            "Inform the employee to ignore it and continue working"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "The FIRST action should always be to disconnect from the network (physically or logically) to prevent potential malware from spreading to other systems."

        question: "Scenario: A database containing customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information) was breached. What is the FIRST legal/ethical step?",

            "Blame the IT team internally to avoid liability"
        ],
        answer: 0,
        explanation: "Most regulations (GDPR, CCPA) require prompt notification when PII is breached. Transparency is both legally required and ethically correct."

            "Ignore it, as DDoS attacks are temporary",
            "Shut down the website indefinitely"
        ],
        answer: 1,
        explanation: "ISPs can implement traffic filtering upstream. Reboots may provide temporary relief but won't stop the attack. Never ignore a sustained DDoS."
    },
    {
        question: "Scenario: A misconfigured cloud storage bucket is exposing sensitive data publicly. What should be done FIRST?",

        title: 'Ransomware',
        description: '<strong>A ransomware attack</strong> is a type of malicious cyberattack where attackers encrypt a victim\'s data or systems, rendering them inaccessible. The attackers then demand a ransom, typically in cryptocurrency, in exchange for the decryption key. Ransomware can spread through phishing emails, malicious attachments, compromised websites, or vulnerabilities in software.',
        approach: `
    <strong>How It Spreads:</strong><br>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Phishing Emails:</strong> Emails contain malicious attachments or links disguised as legitimate files. Attackers often impersonate trusted entities like banks or colleagues. Users are tricked into downloading ransomware by clicking on links or opening attachments. Spear phishing targets specific individuals or organizations for higher success rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Exploiting Vulnerabilities:</strong> Attackers exploit unpatched software or outdated systems to gain access. Common vulnerabilities include flaws in operating systems, browsers, or plugins. Zero-day vulnerabilities (unknown to vendors) are particularly dangerous. Attackers use exploit kits to automate the process of finding and exploiting weaknesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) Attacks:</strong> Hackers use weak or default credentials to gain access to systems via RDP. Brute-force attacks are used to guess passwords through repeated attempts. Once inside, attackers deploy ransomware across the network. RDP is often targeted because it provides direct access to critical systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Malvertising:</strong> Malicious ads are displayed on legitimate websites, often through ad networks. Clicking on these ads redirects users to malicious sites hosting ransomware. Drive-by downloads infect systems without user interaction. Malvertising campaigns are difficult to detect as they use legitimate platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply Chain Attacks:</strong> Attackers compromise software vendors or third-party dependencies. Malicious code is injected into software updates or libraries. Users unknowingly install ransomware when updating or using the software. Examples include the SolarWinds and Kaseya attacks.</li>
    </ul>`,

    types: '<strong>Types of Ransomware Attacks:</strong><br><ul>' +
                        '<li><strong>Encrypting Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files, making them inaccessible without a decryption key. Examples: WannaCry, LockBit, Ryuk.</li>' +
                        '<li><strong>Locker Ransomware:</strong> Locks users out of their devices, preventing access to the system. Examples: WinLocker, Police-themed ransomware.</li>' +
                        '<li><strong>Double Extortion Ransomware:</strong> Encrypts files and threatens to leak sensitive data unless a ransom is paid. Examples: Maze, REvil, Conti.</li>' +
                        '<li><strong>Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS):</strong> Attackers rent ransomware tools from developers to carry out attacks. Examples: DarkSide, LockBit.</li>' +
                        '<li><strong>Mobile Ransomware:</strong> Targets mobile devices, locks them or encrypts files. Examples: SLocker, Koler.</li>' +

Critical business data, such as financial records or customer information, may be lost. Loss of intellectual property can harm long-term business prospects. Data recovery efforts may be time-consuming and costly.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Financial Losses:</strong> Ransom demands can range from thousands to millions of dollars. Recovery costs include IT repairs, forensic investigations, and downtime expenses. Legal fines may be imposed for non-compliance with data protection regulations. Loss of revenue due to halted operations can be devastating.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Operational Disruption:</strong> Businesses may be forced to shut down operations temporarily. Critical services, such as healthcare or utilities, can be severely impacted. Recovery can take days, weeks, or even months, depending on the attack\'s severity. Supply chains may be disrupted, affecting partners and customers.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Customers lose trust in organizations that fail to protect their data. Public disclosure of a breach can harm brand image and customer loyalty. Competitors may gain an advantage by capitalizing on the organization\'s weakened reputation. Rebuilding trust requires significant time and effort.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Legal and Compliance Issues:</strong> Non-compliance with regulations like GDPR or HIPAA can result in hefty fines. Lawsuits may be filed by affected customers or partners. Regulatory investigations can lead to additional penalties and reputational damage. Organizations may be required to implement costly security improvements.</li>' +
    '</ul>',

    actions: '<strong>Actions to Escape:</strong><br><ul>' +
    '<li><strong>Disconnect infected devices:</strong> Immediately isolate affected systems to prevent ransomware from spreading. Disconnect from the internet and internal networks. Turn off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to limit communication channels. Notify IT teams to begin containment efforts.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Check backups:</strong> Verify that backups are not infected or compromised. Use offline or cloud-based backups to restore data. Ensure backups are recent and complete to minimize data loss. Test backups regularly to confirm their reliability.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Avoid paying the ransom:</strong> Paying the ransom does not guarantee file recovery. It encourages attackers to target the organization again. Funds paid may be used to finance further criminal activities. Law enforcement agencies often advise against paying ransoms.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Seek professional help:</strong> Engage cybersecurity experts to assist with incident response. Forensic analysts can identify the attack vector and contain the threat. Legal advisors can help navigate compliance and regulatory issues. Public relations teams can manage communication with stakeholders.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Isolate infected systems:</strong> Quarantine affected devices to prevent lateral movement within the network. Disable shared drives and network access for compromised systems. Monitor network traffic for signs of further spread. Use segmentation to limit the attack’s scope.</li>',

    precautions: '<strong>Precautions to Prevent Ransomware Attacks:</strong><br><ul>' +
    '<li><strong>Backup Data Regularly:</strong> Schedule automated backups, store them in multiple locations, encrypt them, and test their integrity.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Use Strong Passwords & Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Use complex passwords, avoid reuse, and implement MFA for critical systems.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Update & Patch Software:</strong> Apply security patches regularly, enable automatic updates, and replace outdated software.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Be Wary of Phishing Emails:</strong> Verify senders, look for phishing signs, avoid suspicious links, and use email filtering tools.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>Use Endpoint Protection:</strong> Install antivirus software, enable real-time scanning, and monitor for unusual activity.</li>' +

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical Skimmers on Card Readers:</strong> Physical Criminals can attach faux card readers or overlay devices to ATMs, fuel pumps, or POS terminals to capture card data when swiped/inserted into payment terminals, frequently used in conjunction with covertly placed cameras that record PIN entry.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malware-Infected POS Systems:</strong> Infected with Malware Hackers may create malware (e.g., Magecart) to compromise payment terminals or place a malware-infected page on an e-commerce checkout page that secretly steals card numbers during a transaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Wireless Skimmers (Bluetooth-Enabled):</strong> Wireless skimmers are a more advanced form of skimmer that can store card data and send it wirelessly via Bluetooth, allowing criminals to remotely collect the data without needing to physically take the device to another location.</li>

    '<li><strong>ATM Skimming:</strong> Criminals install hidden devices (skimmers) on ATM card slots in order to steal card data. These skimmers may include a hidden camera or keypad overlay, which records the PIN as you enter it. The stolen data can then be used to create counterfeit cards or used to make unauthorized withdrawals.</li>' +
    '<li><strong> POS Skimming:</strong> Criminals compromise payment terminals in stores or restaurants by either deploying malware or using skimmers to record transactions while your card details are entered. In addition, not all skimmers are used remotely—dishonest retail employees may use either handheld skimmers or scammers to take your data as well.</li>' +
    '<li><strong>E-Skimming:</strong> Hackers inject malicious code into e-commerce checkout pages or payment forms to intercept checking card details as they are entered by customers. Hackers often deploy these attacks with little to no detection until a fraudulent payment shows up. These attacks are referred to by many names, such as Magecart. </li>' +

    impact: '<strong>Impact of a PayCard Skimming Attack:</strong><br><ul>' +

            '<li><strong>Use Contactless/NFC or Mobile Wallets:</strong> These methods encrypt payment data that is sent to the retailer. Using these methods limits your exposure to skimmers, as you do not insert a card into a card reader, so it is a safer method than either swiping or inserting a card.</li>' +

                    <li><strong>Use ATMs inside banks (safer than standalone ones):</strong> ATMs inside banks, that the bank monitors, are generally safer to use because they have more security and monitoring.  Your chances of getting skimmed is much lower inside, than a stand-alone ATM out in the open.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enable transaction alerts:</strong>Have real-time text/email and mobile alerts for any charge on your card to detect any or unauthorized activity early and have the time to report it to the originate bank immediately.</li>
